@section s02 Description
DataConverter converts Agilent and Lecroy files into the format used by CUDA Correlation Attacker.

@section s03 How to compile
@subsection s031 Compile DataConverter
Run the following command from the main folder (the folder where Makefile is):
@code
make
@endcode
If everything goes fine a binary executable file named @e converter is created.
@subsection s032 Compile documentation
Run the following command from the main folder:
@code
doxygen documentation.cfg
@endcode
Open doc/html/index.html to read html documentation.\n
In doc/latex, run:
@code
make
@endcode
in order to create pdf documentation file (@e doc/latex/refman.pdf ).


@section s04 How to run
From the main folder, run the following command:
@code
./converter <source1> <source2>
@endcode
@li @e source1: is the full path of the file containing a list of hexadecimal values
@li @e source2: is the full path of the configuration file used during the conversion

See section 1.4 for more details.
@subsection s041 Exit codes
@li 0: everything goes fine
@li 1: command line error
@li 2: setting files parsing error

@section s05 Configuration
The configuration file must contain lines in this format:\n 
@li the couple: \<key\>=\<value\>
@li the special key: \<file_list:\> followed by a full path list of the Agilent or Lecroy files
@li blank lines and any character following # are ignored

The following values must be set in the configuration file

@li @e output_trace_length:  the length of the trace to save in number of samples
@li @e output_trace_offset:  the number of samples to ignore during the conversion
@li @e output_traces_per_file:  the number of traces to save for each output file
@li @e output_path: the location where the output file will be saved
@li @e output_name: the name of the output file to save
@li @e input_format: the format of the input files (Lecroy, Agilent, txt)

@li @e file_list: this special key must be followed by a list of full path of the Agilent or Lecroy files

@section s06 Output file
The converter generates one or more output files (it depends on the configuration settings).\n
An output file contains:\n
@li a header with informations about:
  - the number of traces
  - the number of samples per trace
  - the format of each sample
  - the length of a plain/cipher text in byte
@li a list of traces with a plain/cipher text attached to each trace

Both the traces and the plain/cipher texts are saved in binary format.


Here an example:
@code
--- header ---
number of traces [uint32]
number of samples per trace [uint32]
sample format [char: b for int8, f for float, d for double]
length of a plain/cipher text in byte [uint8]
--- trace 1 ----
trace [in binary format]
plain/cipher text [in binary format]
--- trace 2 ----
.
.
.

--- trace n ----
@endcode

@subsection s061 Sample formats
The samples of a trace could be of four formats. The converter saves this information in the output header 
using a different character for each format.
@li @e int8 saved as 'b'
@li @e int16 saved as 'c'
@li @e float saved as 'f'
@li @e double saved as 'd'
