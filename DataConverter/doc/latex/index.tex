DataConverter converts Agilent and Lecroy files into the format used by CUDA Correlation Attacker.\hypertarget{index_s03}{}\section{How to compile}\label{index_s03}
\hypertarget{index_s031}{}\subsection{Compile DataConverter}\label{index_s031}
Run the following command from the main folder (the folder where Makefile is): 
\begin{DoxyCode}
make
\end{DoxyCode}
 If everything goes fine a binary executable file named {\itshape converter\/} is created. \hypertarget{index_s032}{}\subsection{Compile documentation}\label{index_s032}
Run the following command from the main folder: 
\begin{DoxyCode}
doxygen documentation.cfg
\end{DoxyCode}
 Open doc/html/index.html to read html documentation.\par
 In doc/latex, run: 
\begin{DoxyCode}
make
\end{DoxyCode}
 in order to create pdf documentation file ({\itshape doc/latex/refman.pdf\/} ).\hypertarget{index_s04}{}\section{How to run}\label{index_s04}
From the main folder, run the following command: 
\begin{DoxyCode}
./converter <source1> <source2>
\end{DoxyCode}
 \begin{DoxyItemize}
\item {\itshape source1:\/} is the full path of the file containing a list of hexadecimal values \item {\itshape source2:\/} is the full path of the configuration file used during the conversion\end{DoxyItemize}
See section 1.4 for more details. \hypertarget{index_s041}{}\subsection{Exit codes}\label{index_s041}
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item 0: everything goes fine \item 1: command line error \item 2: setting files parsing error\end{DoxyItemize}
\hypertarget{index_s05}{}\section{Configuration}\label{index_s05}
The configuration file must contain lines in this format:\par
 \begin{DoxyItemize}
\item the couple: $<$key$>$=$<$value$>$ \item the special key: $<$file\_\-list:$>$ followed by a full path list of the Agilent or Lecroy files \item blank lines and any character following \# are ignored\end{DoxyItemize}
The following values must be set in the configuration file

\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item {\itshape output\_\-trace\_\-length:\/} the length of the trace to save in number of samples \item {\itshape output\_\-trace\_\-offset:\/} the number of samples to ignore during the conversion \item {\itshape output\_\-traces\_\-per\_\-file:\/} the number of traces to save for each output file \item {\itshape output\_\-path:\/} the location where the output file will be saved \item {\itshape output\_\-name:\/} the name of the output file to save \item {\itshape input\_\-format:\/} the format of the input files (Lecroy, Agilent, txt)\end{DoxyItemize}
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item {\itshape file\_\-list:\/} this special key must be followed by a list of full path of the Agilent or Lecroy files\end{DoxyItemize}
\hypertarget{index_s06}{}\section{Output file}\label{index_s06}
The converter generates one or more output files (it depends on the configuration settings).\par
 An output file contains:\par
 \begin{DoxyItemize}
\item a header with informations about:
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item the number of traces
\item the number of samples per trace
\item the format of each sample
\item the length of a plain/cipher text in byte 
\end{DoxyItemize}\item a list of traces with a plain/cipher text attached to each trace\end{DoxyItemize}
Both the traces and the plain/cipher texts are saved in binary format.

Here an example: 
\begin{DoxyCode}
--- header ---
number of traces [uint32]
number of samples per trace [uint32]
sample format [char: b for int8, f for float, d for double]
length of a plain/cipher text in byte [uint8]
--- trace 1 ----
trace [in binary format]
plain/cipher text [in binary format]
--- trace 2 ----
.
.
.

--- trace n ----
\end{DoxyCode}
\hypertarget{index_s061}{}\subsection{Sample formats}\label{index_s061}
The samples of a trace could be of four formats. The converter saves this information in the output header using a different character for each format. \begin{DoxyItemize}
\item {\itshape int8\/} saved as 'b' \item {\itshape int16\/} saved as 'c' \item {\itshape float\/} saved as 'f' \item {\itshape double\/} saved as 'd' \end{DoxyItemize}
